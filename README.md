# Basketball Scoreboard

## Description

This the second assignment I was asked to do by Agile Actors during my time there as an apprentice.
It's a basketball scoreboard with complete timers of the total duration, periods and offence time.
You can control it not only from the buttons but also from your keyboard.
Pressing space starts or pauses the timer.
Pressing 1, 2 or 3 from your numpad adds points to the team currently handling the ball.
Pressing the H key you take control of HOME team.
Pressing the G key you take control of GUEST team.
Pressing the R key resets the timer.
Pressing the ESCAPE key resets the whole game.
